# BAIS3300-week7-HW

 In this Homework I made a survey. I made my survey for UIowa Undergraduates. I then uploaded my link to azure and made a page for it.
 
 Web forms are an essential component of many websites and applications, and they must conform to certain best practices to ensure they are user-friendly, accessible, secure, and performant. The first thing I made sure to do is to keep it simple and straightforward. The form has to be easy to understand and fill out.  I avoided using complex language or jargon that may confuse users. I also used clear and concise labels, placeholders, and instructions to guide users. 
 
 The next step is to ensure accessibility. I made sure the form is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. I made sure to use semantic HTML markup and label form elements correctly. I also provided alternative text for my image and multimedia content.
 
The final step was to make sure my website passed WAVE in order to complete the assignment. After fixing many things and making minor adjustments to the project, I got it to pass wave.
